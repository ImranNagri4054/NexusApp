            <h2>Objective:</h2>
            <p>
                The peer review process of The Nexus aims to uphold the highest
                standards of academic integrity, quality, and rigor in the evaluation of submitted manuscripts. Through
                rigorous peer review, we strive to ensure the credibility, validity, and relevance of published
                research.

            <h2>Peer Review Model:</h2>
            <p>
                The Nexus employs a double-blind peer review model, wherein the
                identities of both the authors and the reviewers are kept confidential. This ensures impartiality and
                minimizes potential biases in the evaluation process.

            <h2>Reviewer Selection:</h2>
            <p>
                Reviewers are selected based on their expertise, experience, and scholarly contributions in relevant
                disciplines. The editorial board carefully chooses reviewers who possess the necessary subject matter
                knowledge to provide insightful and constructive feedback on submitted manuscripts.

            <h2>Confidentiality:</h2>
            <p>
                Reviewers are required to maintain the confidentiality of the peer review process. They must not
                disclose any information about the manuscript or their review comments to anyone outside of the
                editorial team. Similarly, authors' identities are concealed from reviewers to ensure unbiased
                evaluation.

                significance, and methodology of the submitted manuscripts. They are encouraged to provide constructive

                Reviewers are requested to complete their evaluations in a timely manner to facilitate the efficient
                processing of submitted manuscripts. While recognizing the voluntary nature of their service, reviewers
                are encouraged to prioritize their reviews and adhere to the journal's specified timelines.

                Reviewers are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that may influence their
                impartiality in reviewing a manuscript. Conflicts of interest may arise from personal, professional, or
                financial relationships with the authors or their institutions. Reviewers with conflicts of interest
                will be recused from evaluating the respective manuscript.
