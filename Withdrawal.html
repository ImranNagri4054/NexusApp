                Authors wishing to withdraw their manuscript from consideration must submit a formal withdrawal request
                to the editorial office of Kashf Journal of Multidisciplinary Research. The withdrawal request should be

            <p>
                Upon receiving a withdrawal request, the editorial team will review the request and assess its validity.
                If the withdrawal request is deemed legitimate and meets the journal's withdrawal criteria, the
                manuscript will be officially withdrawn from consideration for publication.

            <h2>Publication Status:</h2>
            <p>
                If a manuscript has already been published online or in print prior to the withdrawal request, the
                journal will mark the manuscript as "Withdrawn" and include a statement indicating the reason for
                withdrawal, if provided by the authors.

                The Nexus upholds ethical standards in handling withdrawal requests.
                The journal reserves the right to investigate cases of suspected misconduct or unethical behavior
                associated with withdrawal requests and take appropriate actions as necessary.
